This project is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB
The project currently only implements the back-end console.
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend
It can be run both interactively and non-interactively. To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file console.py at the command line.
